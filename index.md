# Music Game/Frequency Reader
This project is a game/device that can do a multitude of things. Firstly, it can read the frequency of a note. Not only that, but it can also take said frequency and match it to a note. Secondly, it can determine whether a note played by someone is correct, comparing it with another note. This is displayed on a small LCD screen that will show both the note and whether it was correct. I chose this project because it seemed suitably challenging for my level and also combined my 2 interests of computer science and music.

# The Sources I Used
this project wouldn't be possible without the help of talented individuals both in this class and on the internet. Here are the majority of the sources I used

-[this instructables article](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Audio-Input/)
note: I also used [this](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Audio-Input/) article, linked on the page

-[the Arduino Documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/)

-[this was my starter project, and it provided a suitable base for me to work on my project and specialize it for this purpose](https://clydelettsome.com/blog/2019/12/18/my-weekend-project-audio-frequency-detector-using-an-arduino/)



# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resources to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad because it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about GitHub is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)

This video is showcasing my starter project. It is comprised of 3 sliders, with each of them controlling how much of a certain color there is. One controls red, one blue, and one green. Each one is connected to an LED of that corresponding color, and depending on how high you push the slider, the light will output at that strength. This can be used to create some color combinations. Sliding up both the red and blue creates magenta, the blue and green create cyan, and the green and red create yellow. Sliding all the sliders creates white. I chose this project because it seemed fun and didn't seem too easy or too challenging. I faced 2 main challenges while doing this project. First, I was using too much solder on each of the joints. However, by using some tips and advice from my instructors, I was able to start using an accurate amount of solder. The second challenge was when I tested it the first time, the light wouldn't work. After talking with my instructors, I learned it was because some of the joints weren't soldered, and they all needed to be soldered. These challenges helped me improve my soldering skills as I overcame them.
